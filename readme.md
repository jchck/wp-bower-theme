# Using Bower with WordPress

Until I met it, Bower was a tool I didn’t realize I needed now, I don’t know how I managed to live so long without it. In short, Bower is a front-end package manager and really comes to shine when those front-end packages are dependent on an author who isn’t you. Examples of front-end pacakges are Bootstrap, Respond.js, Modernizr, or your favorite jQuery slider. What Bower can help you do is: download and install front-end dependencies to a central location, keep them all updated, save you time, and find you a girlfriend.
