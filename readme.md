# Using Bower with WordPress

Until I met it, Bower was a tool I didn't realize I needed, now I don't know how I managed to live so long without it. Bower is a front-end package manager and comes to shine when those front-end packages are dependent on an author who isn't you. Examples of front-end pacakges are Bootstrap, Respond.js, Modernizr, or your favorite jQuery slider. What Bower can help you do is: download and install front-end dependencies to a central location, keep them all updated, save you time, and find you a girlfriend.

One of the beautiful things about Bower is it doesn't care about the application you use it in conjunction with, it works just as easily with WordPress as it does with any other CMS or web project.

To better show Bower in action, I created this simple WordPress theme.

This is part of a [tutorial](http://justinchick.com/using-bower-wordpress/) on using Bower in a WordPress development workflow.
